We use our learned decision tree to determine what kind of animal a dragonfly is. Please ensure you have the *zoo.csv* in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook."

Furthermore, as a reminder, part of your grade is your documentation. Each of the functions that you implemented as part of this assignment **must** be documented. Explain what the function is doing, its inputs/outputs, the logic behind your implementation, fancy Python ~~hacks~~ tricks, etc. Failure to include detailed documentation will result in a penalty.\n",
